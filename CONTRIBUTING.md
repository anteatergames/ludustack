## How to contribute to LuduStack

#### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/anteatergames/ludustack/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/anteatergames/ludustack/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Please, don't do that. We use automated tools to fix those.

#### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/X5Z8dTH) and start talking about your idea.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### Do you have questions about the source code?

* Ask any question about the project at our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/X5Z8dTH).

#### Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

* Yes, please. We need to improve the documentation a lot.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
